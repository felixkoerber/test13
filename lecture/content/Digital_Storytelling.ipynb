    "Before you start setting up your course using Jupyter Book, make sure you have the following tools installed on your machine:\n",
    "- **Git**: A version control system that helps you keep track of your code changes.\n",
    "- **Jupyter Book**: A tool that helps you build and publish interactive books or documents. You can install Jupyter Book using pip install jupyter-book.\n",
    "- A **text editor of your choice**: You can use any text editor, such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom, to create and edit your content.\n",

    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "GitHub Pages is a free web hosting service provided by GitHub. It allows one to easily publish websites directly from a GitHub repository. With GitHub Pages, you can create static websites, blogs, and even project portfolios without having to worry about managing servers or purchasing web hosting.\n",
    "\n",
    "You simply create a repository in GitHub and push your website files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) to the repository. GitHub Pages then automatically generates the website and makes it available at a unique URL. This URL is typically in the format \"username.github.io/repository-name\".\n",
    "\n",
    "GitHub Pages makes it relatively easy to host your own website for developers and programmers, e.g. this course, but can be confusing for non-technical users. \n",
    "A workaround for non-technical users is to work with a preconfigured setup. Our workgroup for example has created a template that you can use to host a website like the one you're seeing right now. This is achieved by using a so called \"github-worklflow\".
