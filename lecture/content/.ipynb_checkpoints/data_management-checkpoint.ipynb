    "# Data-mangament\n",
    "\n",
    "The topic of data managment can seem quite trivial for beginners, but starting out with best practices will make your future significantly easier and help ensure your data is well-organized and secure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Setup local folder structure (BIDS)\n",
    "\n",
    "Neuroimaging data:\n",
    "\n",
    "It is recommended to adopt a standarized approach to structuring your data, as this not only helps you stay consistent, but also allows you and possible collaborators to easily identify where specific data is located.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most promising/popular approach to this is [BIDS](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/) (Brain Imaging Data Structure). Originally conceptualizes as a standarized format for the organization and description of fMRI data, the format can be extended to encompass other kinds of neuroimaging and corresponding behavioral data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "For the public good\n",
    "- if widely adopted makes it inherently more easier to reproduce code and anylsis pipelines build by others, therefore lowering scientific waste and improving efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "For yourself\n",
    "\n",
    "- You are likely the future user of the data and data analysis pipelines youâ€™ve developed, so keeping your file structure standarized removes the need to remember where you've stored specific pieces of data etc.\n",
    "- Enables and simplifies collaboration\n",
    "- Reviewers and funding agencies like to see clear, reproducible results\n",
    "- Open-science based funding opportunities and awards available (for instance: OHBM Replication Award, Mozilla Open Science Fellowship, Google Summer of Code, and so on.)\n",

    "## Data storage:\n",
    "\n",
    "Now while having a standarized data format, let's turn towards the topic of data storage. While for small projects or purely behavioral research your local file system may seem initially sufficient, for larger datasets and file sizes, such as in neuroimaging, you'll quickly run out of storage. The same applies when you collect a larger number of smaller projects throughtout your career, of course. Further, do we really want to store data simply on some laptop until it is forgotten/deleted and in general inaccessible to others who might make use of it?\n",
    "\n",
    "But sharing data falls under the jurisdiction of local laws, e.g. the DSGVO\n",

    "Nowadays there are a lot of cloud storage options, which additionally allow researchers to share their data given certain rules and restrictions. The following is an incomplete, but somewhat exhaustive list of the possible storage options you face.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Open Science Repositories: Repositories such as OSF, OpenNeuro, the OpenfMRI database, and the IEEE DataPort provide open access to MRI and EEG datasets, as well as other neuroimaging data.\n",
    "\n",
    "National Institutes of Health: The National Institutes of Health (NIH) provides open access to many MRI and EEG datasets through their National Library of Medicine's National Institutes of Health Data Sharing Repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Research Data Repositories: Zenodo, Figshare, and other research data repositories allow scientists to store, share, and publish their data in an open and transparent manner. These repositories are often committed to open access principles and provide a centralized location for data and metadata, as well as version control and preservation features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud Storage Services: Some cloud storage services, such as Google Drive, have features that support open science practices, such as collaboration tools and version control.\n",
    "\n",
    "Research Collaborations: Collaborative projects, such as the Human Connectome Project, the International Neuroimaging Data-Sharing Initiative (INDI), and the ABIDE (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) project, provide open access to large datasets collected from multiple sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "Research Papers: Some researchers may make their data available alongside their publications in open access journals or through the publication's data repository\n",
    "\n",
    "Domain-Specific Repositories: There are also domain-specific repositories for various scientific fields, such as the NCBI Sequence Read Archive for genomics data, the European Geosciences Union Data Centre for Earth and Environmental Science data, and the International Astronomical Union's SIMBAD database for astronomical data. These repositories often have specific requirements for data deposition and sharing, but provide a dedicated space for researchers to share their data in an open and transparent manner.\n",
