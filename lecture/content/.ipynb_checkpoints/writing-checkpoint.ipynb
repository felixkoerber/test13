    "#### Writing a scientific paper\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing a scientific paper can be a challenging task, but with a well-structured approach and a few helpful tips, it can be a rewarding experience. A scientific paper is a formal way to communicate your research findings to the scientific community and is an essential part of the scientific process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is a typical structure for a scientific paper:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Introduction: Provide background information and the purpose of the study. State the research question and explain why it is important.\n",
    "2. Methods: Describe the methods and procedures used in the experiment, including any equipment and materials used.\n",
    "3. Results: Present your findings, including any data and statistical analyses. Use tables, figures, and graphs to help illustrate the results.\n",
    "4. Discussion: Interpret the results and discuss their implications. Compare your results with previous research and suggest future directions for research.\n",
    "5. Conclusion: Summarize the main findings and their significance.\n",
    "6. References: List the sources cited in the paper in a consistent format (e.g. APA, MLA).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach can be futrher adapted to structured reports, but make sure to check back on the specfics of your individual assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tips for Junior Scientists:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Be concise and to the point. Avoid unnecessary words/phrases.\n",
    "- Use clear and simple language. Avoid technical phrases unless necessary\n",
    "- Be thorough and accurate in reporting your results. Include all relevant data and any limitations (better to cut later than to have to redo the work, because you missed important implications)\n",
    "- Support your claims and conclusions with references, as much as possible\n",
    "- Review and revise your work several times before submitting it. Pay attention to grammar, spelling, and formatting.\n",
