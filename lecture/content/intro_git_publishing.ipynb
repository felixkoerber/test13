    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As already mentioned, Github is a web-based plattform for store, organize, and managing projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Content is mainly organized in repositories (or \"repos\" for short), these repos can be viewed as being equivalent to a normal directory, that you have on your local machine for e.g. storing data, pictures.\n",
    "They may contain a variety of file-types and nested directories, and will be used as a place to store and organize your project files, including code, assets and documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Here you see the repository for the course template that you'll be working with. Don't worry if that's still confusing to you, learning how to work with Github is best done using a \"learning-bydoing\" approach.\n",

    "#### Version control and collaborative work\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm sure we've all lost important document, code or progress while working in academia. If you've been doing programming work, you might also have encountered that fixing a bug may lead to othe substantial bugs down the line. \n",
    "So people generally tend to come up with their on solution for \"project managment\", e.g. by maintaining multiple files, e.g. project_working_copy_1.txt, project_notes.txt,  project_final_draft_3 or at times by making a mess of our documents by storing cut or to be implemented content in it's own sub-section at the end of project_draft_4.txt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Github alleviates that problem by making use of \"Git\" a distributed version control system, which logs each time a change is made to a file. Via the commit system we can not only maintain different versions of the same file on e.g. your local system and the connected public repository, but also revert changes that had negative consequences or recover information lost on your system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Git further makes it easy to work with multiple users on the same project, as each user can maintain their local versions and submit their changes to the public directory, that can then be reviewed by the team on quality and compatibility and subsequently be incorporated into the online project.\n",

    "[**Forking**](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks): Creating a copy of someones repository, that you want to work with. Forks let you make changes to a project without affecting the original repository. I.e. you'll create an online copy of anothers repository under your github account.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "[**Cloning**](https://www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/tutorials/what-is-git-remote): Meaning to create a local copy of an online repository (called \"remote\"s on your system.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "[**Branching**](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches): Meaning to create a copy of a project either onliny or locally, so that you have an isolated copy where you can work without affecting other branches in a repository. Each repository has one default branch, usually called \"main\" branch, and can have multiple other branches.\n",
    "\n",
    "[**Comitting**](https://www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/tutorials/what-is-git-commit): A commit is a \"snapshot\" of your repository at one specific point in time. If you make changes to a repository, you'll have to follow up with \"comitting\" the changes to save file changes to your Git repository. This does not mean that your changes will be lost, if you e.g. shutdown your system just that the version between a file on your system and the logged version in the github repository do not match.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "[**Pulling**](https://www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/tutorials/what-is-git-pull): Means simply to update you local repository with the corresponidng online (remote) repository. E.g. if you've or someone else made changes to the online version of a repository you pull or \"download\" these changes to your local files this way.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**2. Clone the repository**: To start working with your repository, you'll need to \"clone\" it to your local computer. This will create a copy of the repository on your computer that you can work with. To clone a repository, click on the \"Clone or download\" button and copy the URL. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Make changes**: Now that you have a local copy of the repository, you can make changes to the code. Simply open the files in your editor and make the changes you want or create new files and folders.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Commit changes**: When you're done making changes, you'll need to \"commit\" them to the repository. Committing a change records it in the repository's history and makes it part of the codebase. \n",
    "    \n",
    "`BASH`:To commit a change, run the following commands in the terminal: git add ., git commit -m \"Your commit message\". Replace \"Your commit message\" with a brief description of the changes you made.\n",

    "`Gitkraken`:  Click on `file`, `open repo` and select the repo containing your changes. On the left hand side you'll see the \"file\" overview. Under unstaged files you can review your changes. Click the grenn \"stage all changes\" button or right click on inidvidual files/folders and select \"stage\". The files will be added to the \"staged\" files windows.
