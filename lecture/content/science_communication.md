# Science communication: Publication and Beyond

So you have worked hard on your research topic, and now want to share your findings with the world. How would do that? In this section we want to explore just that.


### The Turing Way: Everything you need to know for Science Communication

The go-to ressource for modern, digital science communication was created by the [Turing Way Project](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/index.html) (which also uses Jupyter Book for their website).

### Publication

The main avenue of science communication has almost always been the `Journal Publication`. Going from a research project to a publication is a very complex and time-consuming process and to explain it here, would a) exceed the scope of this project and b) has its own limitiations, which is why we won't detail this traditional process here.

However, a new developing in science communication is the so called `preprint`.

A `preprint` is an early version of a scientific manuscript that is made publicly available online `prior to formal peer review and publication` in a journal. The main benefits of preprints are:

- `Faster dissemination of research findings`: Preprints allow researchers to make their work public as soon as it is ready, allowing other researchers and the general public to access and build upon their findings more quickly.

- `Improved visibility and impact`: Preprints increase the visibility of research by making it more discoverable online, which can lead to greater impact and more citations.

- `Enhanced collaboration and feedback`: Preprints provide researchers with an opportunity to receive early feedback from the community and collaborate with other researchers, leading to improved research quality and productivity.

The most common platforms for publishing preprints in the field of scientific research are:

   -  [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/): A popular platform for preprints in physics, mathematics, computer science, and other related fields.

    - [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/): A platform for preprints in the life sciences and biology.

    - [SocArXiv](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv): A platform for preprints in the social sciences.




#### Creating an open & reproducible publication from scratch

Many of the things we've discussed here are further implemented in the in-depth guide on how to create an open and reproducable publication in the field of neuroimaging. If you're interested in building a portfolio and doing open research, follow this guide:

### Building your personal website

As a reseacher it is essential to connect with others, it is therefore sensible to manage your online presence by creating a personal website to communicate your work, how you can be reached etc. This can also be used as your personal blog, which is a great starting point to level up your writing skills and learn how to think, write and communicate your ideas more clearly.

Nowadays, it is easy to build your personal website and there are many ways that lead to that goal. A free solution is hosting your personal website via GitHub Pages. Thanks to intuitive templates, this is a relatively easy task!

Check out the personal website of our affiliate [Dr. Peer Herholz](https://peerherholz.github.io/) to get an idea, how your website might look.

There are many great tutorials that help you to get to a similiar point quickly.

#### Closing words

Effective science communication is essential for ensuring that scientific research is `accessible, understandable, and impactful`. By using a variety of tools and strategies, scientists and science communicators can engage with a broad audience, share their findings in clear and engaging ways, and promote positive change in society.

One powerful tool for promoting effective science communication is the use of `prepublications`, which can help researchers share their findings with the scientific community in a `timely and transparent manner`. In addition, the use of websites hosted via Github Pages can provide a valuable platform for scientists to share their research with a broader audience, in a way that is `accessible, engaging, and interactive`.

Ultimately, the goal of science communication is to `bridge the gap` between the scientific community and the broader public, and to foster a greater understanding of the role that science plays in our lives. By using a range of tools and strategies, scientists and science communicators can help to promote scientific literacy, inspire curiosity and wonder, and empower individuals to make informed decisions about their health, their environment, and their future.
