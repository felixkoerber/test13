# Introduction I

Within the first session we'll spend a fair amount of time on talking about the structure, content, goal and implementation of the course to hopefully answer most of your questions and set the stage for the subsequent meetings! This will also entail an introduction section to get to know the folks around you. Additionally, we'll direct our attention towards the [Setup]() section of this notebook, to install the software required for this course.
