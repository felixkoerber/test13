Hello everyone and welcome to the course page!

Within this course we will explore the `concept of digital literacy`, its implications for students and researchers in the context of the academic system progressively shifting their curriculum and ressources into the digital space. We'll further explore the ways to apply and expand on existing skills concerning digital literacy. 

## **Digital literacy in higher education**

`Digital literacy` has become an essential skill for success in today's technology-driven world. It is especially crucial for students who are interested in pursuing `empirical research`. Empirical research involves collecting and analyzing data, and it requires a deep understanding of the digital tools and platforms used in data collection and analysis. 

By the end of the course, students will be equipped with the skills and knowledge needed to `navigate and communicate effectively in the academic digital world`. They will further be able to critically evaluate the impact of digital technologies and tools on the way we collect, transform and communicate information in the sciences.

This course is `open` to all students, `regardless of their previous experience` with digital technologies. However, it is tailored towards students with little to no prior experience. Extra lessons pertaining to more complex skills for e.g. Neuro- or Data-science can be found in the "advanced content" section.

As this course is primarily centered around scientific practice, we will not be dealing with basic topics such as "What is this internet?", "what's a meme?" or "how do i use social media?".  We will further not be dive into the concepts more commonly labeled under "media literacy", such as how to spot fake news etc..

### What you'll be learning üìç

**At the end of the course, students will be able to:**

* understand the concept of digital literacy and it's implications on society and academic culture
* Use digital tools and technologies effectively, as well as assess and choose digital tools based on their suitability for specific tasks related to science/academia.
* basic coding skills in BASH & Python and why they are important for scientific work
* coding environments: what they are and how to leverage them for your work
* how to find, evaluate data & Information in a digital environment
* Data-managament and the basics of version control using GITHUB
* how to plan and manage a scientific project and pick the right tools for the job
* produce and distribute multimedia content to convey [the subject's] opinions and thoughts, as well as communicate effectively in digital environments, visulaze data & results
* Understand the ethical and social implications of digital technologies
* demonstrate awareness of ethical issues related to academic integrity surrounding the access and use of information



### Course structure

The course is divided into `several modules`, each covering a different aspect of digital literacy. The modules include `interactive lectures, readings, activities, and assessments` (as well as guest lectures from experts in the field). The following section will illustrate the structure of the contents contained.
