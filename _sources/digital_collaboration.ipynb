    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In mordern science, collaboration is key for producing high-quality research that can advance our understanding of the world around us.\n",
    "The Covid-19 pandemic only exacerbated the `necessities of digital spaces` in academia in elsewhere, since work often depends on researchers and colleagues in remote places due to international partnerships, scientific conferences or reserach visitations. \n",
    "Subsequently, online collaborative writing tools have become increasingly important to facilitate effective communication and teamwork. \n",
    "\n",
    "These tools allow multiple researchers to work on the same document simultaneously, share ideas, provide feedback, and track changes in real-time, making the research process more efficient and productive. Moreover, online collaborative writing tools enable researchers from different disciplines and regions to collaborate more easily, breaking down barriers and fostering innovation. In this way, these tools have become indispensable for modern scientific research.\n",
    "In a [previous lecture](), we talked about `Google Docs` as a tool for collaborative writing, the following part will list a number of digital tools that you can use for collaborative work and where to learn more.\n",
