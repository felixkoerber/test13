    "Writing a good paper takes time and practice. We'll walk thorugh a paper by [Mensh & Kording (2017)]((https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005619)) providing rules for scientific writing. These rules aim to introduce a frame of reference on how to get started with scientific writing, continously improve and avoid mistakes and furstrations. \n",

    "</br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll go over general principles regarding writing for an audience (rules 1 - 4), the different components of an paper and what they are each trying to communicate (rules 5 - 8) and lastly some considerations for the writing process itself (rules 9 - 10). \n",
    "\n",
    "The images below provides a short summary of the 10 rules we'll discuss and how violations of these rule might manifest. It's a good idea to check back once you've read the rest of the chapter to evaluate your understanding, but it can be further used as a checklist for good writing in your future endeavours.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of the ten rules and how to tell if they are being violated; \n",
    "Table 1. [Mensh & Kording (2017); doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005830](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005619)\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Principles (Rules 1–4)\n",
    "\n",
    "Following we'll introduce general writing principles to optimize the reader’s experience and effectively communicate the aims of our work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Focus your paper on a central contribution, which you communicate in the title\n",
    "\n",
    "A paper ideally aims to provide a single contribution, multiple contributions tend to be less convincing, therefore less memorable. The title is here a crucial part, as it's the first element a reader encounters and determines if people will read even the abstract. Focus on a single message, transmitted by the title, but don't over-sell.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Write for flesh-and-blood human beings who do not know your work\n",
    "\n",
    "You as the writer will be the expert on your work, but we'll have to assume that reader's may possibly be naive to the work or field. Therefore we need to consider the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - quality and how clear your writing is can be nearly impossible to judge work from perspective of naive reader\n",
    "\n",
    "    - an approach from the perspective of naive reader means to make clear \"why do you need to understand/care about this problem\" and how the paper answers the problem/question (ideally understandable with minimal effort).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - define technical terms and avoid abbreviations/acronyms \n",
    "        - adapt to working memory constraints of humans\n",
    "        - 2-3 abbreviations in total, write out first time with abbreviation in ()\n",
    "        - avoid using different words for same concept/thing -> confuses the reader\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Stick to the context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme \n",
    "\n",
    "Scientific papers benefit from being written in a classical story structure with a discernible beginning, a well-defined body, and an conclusive end. Therefore we make use of the context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The C-C-C scheme defines the structure of the paper on multiple scales:\n",
    "\n",
    "`for the whole paper:`\n",
    "\n",
    "        - introduction = context\n",
    "        - methods/results = body\n",
    "        - discussion =  conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "`for each paragraph:`\n",
    "\n",
    "        - first sentence = defines the topic or context\n",
    "        - body = novel content put forth for the reader’s consideration\n",
    "        - last sentence = provides the conclusion to be remembered\n",
    "\n",
    "The C-C-C scheme produces texts aimed at more patient readers, that take their time to engage and interact with a text.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's best to generally avoid writing for impatient readers. We'll have to rely on the title and abstract for this, but these can be caught via presenting the most exciting content first, while neccesarily following up with important context to remain credible.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Optimize your logical flow by avoiding zig-zag and using parallelism\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid zig-zag through your story:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - only the central idea should be touched upon multiple times\n",
    "    - minimize number of subject changes\n",
    "    - string related paragraphs together without interruptions by unrelated materials\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead make use of the parallelism, to provide structure\n",
    "\n",
    "    - parallel messages -> parallel form -> easier for reader\n",
    "    - communicate different points of overarching topic using same syntax\n",
    "    \n",

    "        Introduction: \n",

    "\n",

    "### 8. Discuss how the gap was filled, the limitations of the interpretation, and the relevance to the field\n",
    "\n",
    "The discussion aims to explain how results have filled the gap identified in the introduction, provides caveats to our interpretations and describes how the findings advance the field. Overall provide a step-by-step outline to put the conclusions of the paper into context.\n",

    "\n",
    "    Collaborative Editing: Google Docs allows multiple users to edit the same document in real-time, making it easy for teams to work together on a project. You can invite people to view, comment, or edit a document, and see who is making changes in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Version History: Google Docs keeps a record of all changes made to a document, so you can easily go back and view previous versions. You can also compare different versions of a document side by side.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Templates: Google Docs includes a variety of templates for different types of documents, such as resumes, letters, and reports. You can use these templates to quickly create professional-looking documents with a consistent look and feel.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Add-ons: Google Docs has a large library of add-ons that can be installed to add extra functionality to your documents. For example, you can install an add-on to add a table of contents, or another to create charts and graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits of Google Docs for Collaborative Work\n",
    "\n",
    "    Accessibility: Google Docs is accessible from anywhere with an internet connection, making it easy for team members to work together from different locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Real-time Collaboration: Google Docs allows multiple users to edit the same document in real-time, making it easier for teams to work together on projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Increased Productivity: Google Docs’ version history and commenting system make it easier for teams to keep track of changes, provide feedback, and make decisions, leading to increased productivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Improved Communication: Google Docs’ commenting system allows team members to communicate directly within a document, improving the flow of communication and reducing the need for separate email exchanges.\n",
