    "SSH (Secure Shell) is a secure protocol used to remotely access and manage computer systems over an unsecured network. Or simpler it provides a user access to a remote computer or computer systems, by defining a set of rules and procedures for transmitting data between computers.\n",
    "It uses encryption protocols to protect sensitive information exchanged between devices, making it a secure way to access remote servers and devices. SSH is therefore commonly used by organizations or insitutions to access or analyse sensitive data. \n",
    "\n",
    "In academia or clinical insitutions, e.g. in neuroscience research, you may encounter SSH as a means to log in to a remote server and execute commands, transfer large files, or perform analysis that a regular computer could not handle or that would be incredibly time comsuming."

    "If your work requires you to work with SSH, you'll be usually introduced to the local IT support, that teaches you how to access their server systems and what permissable operations you might perform. Here is what you can expect from this interaction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Depending on your operating system you will either be installing a SSH client on your machine (e.g.  Solar-PuTTY for Windows), on MacOS and Linux you'll instead use the terminal. Normally you will provided access to a computer designated for that purpose using macOS/Linux\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Next a public/private key pair for you local machine will be generated. This is used to authenticate your machine to the remote server. Think of it as a work ID that your computer gets assigned, which will be checked against a list of registered machines, when accessing the remote server. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Now open the installed SSH client or terminal on your local machine and enter the following command\n",
    "   \n",
    "   `ssh <user>@<remote_server_IP>`\n",
    "    \n",
    "    (where user is your username on the remote server and remote_server_IP the IP address or hostname of the remote server. Both will most liekly be provided by the system administrator.)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. You will be prompted to enter your password. Once you enter the correct password, you will be logged into the remote server over an encrypted SSH connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "But you'll probably soon realize somethin shocking: the lack of the GUI (Graphical User Interface)!\n",
    "As SSH is a service used for managing data in the most efficient way we're usually constrained to text-based communication with the machine. The most common language used for this purpose is called BASH (Bourne Again SHell). \n",
    "\n",
    "BASH (Bourne-Again SHell) is a widely used command-line interface (CLI) for Unix-based operating systems. If you open up a on your [macOS terminal](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/open-or-quit-terminal-apd5265185d-f365-44cb-8b09-71a064a42125/mac) or [Linux terminal](https://itsfoss.com/open-terminal-ubuntu/), you'll be able to use BASH commands to directly comunicate with your machine to do basic operations such as creating, deleting or moving files and directories, as well as runs more complicated automatization processes.\n",
