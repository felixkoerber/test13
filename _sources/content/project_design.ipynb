    "The process of doing science has changed drastically over the years. While it is of course still possible to simply maintain a word document with all your ideas, notes, citations or i.e code snippets & statistics or to simply store your data and writing in whatever way feels comfortable for you, there has been a number of new tools and standards that will make your life much easier and turn you into a more organized/better scientist/student.\n",
    "\n",
    "Project design is mostly concerned with the initial process planing and organizing the framework to conduct reserach in. This might seem trivial, but is essential. It allows us not only to more deeply engage with our research question, but is also relevant for the reproducibility of a project.\n",
    "\n",
    "An inidviudal project will surivive longer than the research that is done on it and will (potentially) influence the scientific consensus on a given topic down the line by providing data, insights or new methods. Therefore managing the presence and meticulously documenting what was done, what decisons were made and where the gathered information and data is stored is essential to the long-term impact of your work.\n",

    "For this puprose the following chapters will explore how to setup a project in the \"digital age\", what tools to use, what to look out for and where you may find more information.\n",
