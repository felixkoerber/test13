# Course overview & procedure

"Digital literacy": the ability to independently find, evaluate, communicate, and handle information from digital media (Shopova 2014). This is not only relevant for dealing with the prominent complexity, limited accessibility, and lack of transparency of digital infrastructure, but is also necessary for independent research in the empirical sciences. Traditional teaching concepts are often not oriented towards the acquisition of digital literacy, instead, a dependence on taught methods and media as well as university resources is created through the use of proprietary software packages and the absence of exemplary applications in real life.

This becomes a problem as society and especially academia trends toward a migration into digital spaces. Additionally, the majority of experimental work within science requires the use of computers. No matter if “simple” literature search, data managment, data acquisition or analyses, computer-aided research is almost impossible to avoid and if done right, can be incredible helpful and even enable new types of analyses to obtain insights that are otherwise inaccessible. Rather surprisingly to most folks, the efficient utilization of computers within research also includes programming or even requires it. Besides making research faster, more streamlined, efficient, stable, eaier to reproduce and less prone to errors, some parts of the research workflow might actually require certain programming skills

While most thesis projects (undergrad and grad), PhD and other positions that actively work with `data` expect `programming` knowledge and/or experience, most programs however don't enable students to gather this skill set as their curricula don't include respective courses or do not provide adequate support and time to hone this skillset. Obviously, we won't be able to turn you into experts on all things digital, but this course is intended to provide you with a good basic understanding of the necessary knowledge and tools to navigate the pitfalls of scientif work. Specifically, this course should build the basis for further endeavors, setting you up with everything you need to know for that (especially how and when to look for help).    

Within this course we, therefore, will explore what it means to be "digitally literate" and porvide you with a basic Setup, enabling  scientific work using open source tools. 

(To do so, we will follow a "learning by doing" approach in a tripartite manner. Starting from a basic introduction into `Digital Literacy` (Block I), `specific abilities & skillsets` (Block II) and `advanced content for scientific work using open source toools` (Block III).)


More specificaly we will structure our work into the chapters

- Introduction to digital literacy
    - 
- Media and Information literacy
    - get to know the tools and benefitis of research in the digital age
- Communication and Collaboration
    - learn how to network, communicate and share your work in digital spaces
- Digital scholarship
    -  learn about academic and professional practices that depend on digital systems and emergent technology

Thus, we actively seek out `realistic examples` and deomstrate how an open-source `workflow` could look like.  Along the way we will also talk about important adjacent topics such as `computing environments` and `IDE`s.


### TL;DR

Society is drifting into a digital world, while students are often left to fend for themselves or aquire the necessary skills to adapt to these changes on their own.

This course will therefore explore the concept of digital literacy and its components, in an attempt to provide students with the necessary understanding and skills to self-sufficiently navigate digital spaces, aquire the necessary skillsets and contribute to the academic and scientific communities!

### Gimme the details

Below you will find important details regarding the course summarized in a compact form. Please consult and familiarize yourself with the information presented there prior to and/or within the first few days of the course. 

#### When and where

This course is designed for self-study, therefore there will be no meeting dates. Homework and coding assignments are to be treated as excercies to train the application of digital technologies in a research context. Links fo downloading solutions will be provided at the end of the respective sections of the assignment,


We'll further host a discord server where you can get in contact, as well as ask and get your questions answered,  an invitation will be provided by the content cretaors upon request (just simply shoot us an e-mail at the above mentioned adress).


#### Can I use my calculator?

Well, depends on your calculator, but you'll need frequent access to a computer that can run differnt programms, as well as programming languages such as BASH or Python. None of the excercises we will be doing will be especially computationally intensive, so you won't necessarily need a modern or "fast" computer. Still, your machine will need to be running a standard operating system like Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux. Unfortunately, tablets running mobile operating systems (iOS, Android) probably won't work for relevant parts of this course. **If you're a student of the Goethe-University and this is an issue for you, please get in touch with the instructor as soon as possible so that we can try to figure out a solution**. Regarding software and installation thereof, please check the next section.


#### How do I get all the software and do I have to apply for a loan to get it?

Nah, everything we'll use is [open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) or at minimum free of charge and publicly available. 
Why? Because teaching students via [proprietary software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software) is just not fair and won't help anyone: students have to obtain licenses or use those from the university (which usually doesn't have enough for everyone), leading to tremendous problems regarding inequity now and in the future. Additionally, [opens-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) can do everything, if not more than [proprietary software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software) and is furthermore usually better supported, tested and documented, creating a fantastic sense of community. 

In order to help you get all the software required for the course, a [comprehensive installation instruction](x) was compiled. In a step-by-step manner it guides you through the installation process, covering several `OS`: `windows`, `macos` and `linux`. Now the installation of the required packages probably goes beyond the scope of how most people engage with their computers on a daily basis, therefore errors and following frustration may occur. **Please do not be discouraged! If any problems occur during the installation process, please feel free to contact us ASAP and we'll get that sorted out**


#### Where is everything?

All course materials will be available on this very course website. Everything will be completely open and free to use, thus constituting an [open educational resource](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources) you are **free to explore, enhance and share**. Thus, this website and all materials will also remain up ideally to end of the internet, but will possibly be subject to changes and updates. If you feel the need to save this ressource as it is at the moment you're reading this, you can download the complete course from our github repo [here]. The usage of this resource and the materials therein will be explained at the beginning and throughout the course.  


#### Syllabus and Text

As noted above, this page serves as the syllabus for this course, with the precise outline indicated in the [respective section](x). This syllabus may be subject to change at the content creators discretion.

Additional reading material might be added but will always be open & free with students being informed about any addition.
If you'd like to contribute, share ideas or feel as if there are inaccuracies in the course materials, do contact us on the [courses github page](x) or via e-mail.


#### How to get those credits?

This course is not designed for the purpose of collecting course credits in the context of your education at the Goethe University Frankfurt. Should this ever be subject to change this section will provide all necessary information for students.

##### Exams and Assignments

None, as of yet. There will be a number of exercises accompanying most lessons, though.

### Code of conduct

This course has a `Code of conduct`. Please inform yourself about the specifics by carefully reading through the [respective section](x).

### How to Get Your Question(s) Answered and/or Provide Feedback

It’s great that we have so many ways to communicate, but it can get tricky to figure out who to contact or where your question belongs or when to expect a response. These guidelines are to help you get your question answered as quickly as possible and to ensure that we’re able to get to everyone’s questions.

That said, to ensure that we’re respecting everyone's time we'll mainly answer questions between normal working hours (M-F 9AM-6PM). However, we know that may not be when you may be doing your work. So, please feel free to post messages whenever is best for you while knowing that if you post late at night or on a weekend, you may not get a response until the next weekday. As such, do your best not to wait until the last minute to ask a question.

If you have:

**... auestions about course content:** 
these are awesome! We want everyone to see them and have their questions answered too, so either use the [hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/) plugin, `e-mail` or the [GitHub repository](x).

**... a technical assignment question** 
shoot an e-mail and make an appointment. Answering technical questions is often best accomplished ‘in person’ where we can discuss the question and talk through ideas. However, if that is not possible, post your question to `discord`. Be as specific as you can in the question you ask (and include error messages when appropriate!). And, for those answering, help your classmates as much as you can without just giving the answer. Help guide them, point them in a direction, provide pseudo code, but do not provide code that answers assignment questions.

**...been stuck on something for a while (>30min) and aren’t even really sure where to start:** 
Programming can be frustrating and it may not always be obvious what is going wrong or why something isn’t working. **That’s OK - we’ve all been there!** IF you are stuck, you can and should reach out for help, even if you aren’t exactly sure what your specific question is. To determine when to reach out, consider the 2-hour rule. This rule states that if you are stuck, work on that problem for an hour. Then, take a 30 minute break and do something else. When you come back after your break, try for another 30 minutes or so to solve your problem. If you are still completely stuck, stop and contact us (office hours, post on `discord`). If you don’t have a specific question, include the information you have (what you’re stuck on, the code you’ve been trying that hasn’t been happening, and/or the error messages you’ve been getting).

**...something super cool to share related to class or want to talk about a topic in further depth:**
Feel free to post on `discord`, contact the instructors or come to office hours.
